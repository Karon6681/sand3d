"""Articulations: how a part moves on another.

A joint is written on its child, the part that moves — an object or a group — and
hangs it on the part its frame `on` was read on, the parent. It does not move the
child and it does not reparent it: the kinematic tree (child -> parent) is kept apart
from the scene tree, which still says what welds to what. A part with no joint moves
with its group; a jointed part moves by its joint, whatever group it is in. The bodies
of a mechanism are its jointed parts and, for everything else, the root.

What a child carries, as custom properties (so `copy` carries it too):

- `s3d~joints`: its joints in declaration order, JSON — name, kind, the pivot frame in
  the child's own space at rest (`pivot`, which so moves with the child: `transform`
  moves a jointed part with its pivot, and the image of a mirrored child moves as the
  image of the motion), the axis in that frame, the range, what it follows, the ratio,
  the value it is posed at;
- `s3d~parent`: the part its joints hang on;
- `s3d~follows.<k>`: the child whose joint the k-th follows;
- `s3d~rest`: its placement in its scene parent at rest.

Several joints on one child compose in declaration order, the first nearest the
parent: a cylindrical joint is a slide and a turn, a screw a slide and a turn that
follows it.
